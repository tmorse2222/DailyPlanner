User Story:<br>
AS AN employee with a busy schedule<br>
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner<br>
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively<br>
<br>
Acceptance Criteria:<br>
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule<br>
WHEN I open the planner<br>
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar<br>
WHEN I scroll down<br>
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours<br>
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day<br>
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future<br>
WHEN I click into a time block<br>
THEN I can enter an event<br>
WHEN I click the save button for that time block<br>
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage<br>
WHEN I refresh the page<br>
THEN the saved events persist<br>
<br>
This challenge utilizes jQuery to allow for dynamic changes in HTML and CSS. Although provided starter HTML and CSS, heavy edits were made to both, while the JS script is original. The use of jQuery to create, change, and save HTML and CSS is the key feature of this application.
